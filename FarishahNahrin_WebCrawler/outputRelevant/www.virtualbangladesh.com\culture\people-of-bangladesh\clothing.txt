What do people wear in Bangladesh?, As you may have found out by now Bangladesh is a subtropical country with a short winter. You need to wear light clothes at most times while in winter a sweater or something warm might be reasonable., Bangladesh is primarily a Muslim and conservative country and so there are certain things one should not wear. Female visitors should maintain a conservative dress standard and avoid showing much flesh beyond head, hands, and feet. Long lightweight skirts (or trousers) with a cotton blouse tend to work best for business situations. Immodest dress may attract unsolicited attention., Lungi, A cotton lungi and a jersey called kurta are the common attire for men in rural areas. A lungi is a loop of cloth, somewhat like a very, very loose skirt or a sarong. It hangs from the waist to the ankles and is gathered in front at the waist and twisted into a sort of half knot, with the ends tucked in so they won’t unravel. If a Bengali boy wants to run, swim, fish, or play, he can pull the bottom of the lungi up and tuck it into his waist, ready for action. On special occasions, they may wear a pajama-panjabi. In the urban areas men have, however, largely adapted to western costume., Salwar Kameez, Sari, Sari is women’s universal dress, both in the cities and countryside. A sari a long piece of cloth that they wrap around their waist, tucking it in at the waist, then wrapping it around their shoulders. Usually they also wear a blouse. The top part of the sari can rest around the back of the neck or be pulled over the top of the head, leaving the face uncovered. Some girls and some women wear a Salwar Kameez.
