I have in my possession “Prottakhho Drashir Chokhe Muktijouddho” (Eye Witness Reports of the War of Liberation). Edited by Haroon Habib and published by Abdul Kadir Khan, Nawroaze Kitabistan. The book is a collection of personal stories of what transpired during the Liberation War. This translation is an almost literal one, and should exlain the stilted English, and the preponderances of commas, and strange metaphors and similes. I couldn’t find the energy in polishing the translation so the readers will have to bear with this Saturday afternoon endeavour.
