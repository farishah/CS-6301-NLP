Kabaddi, Kabaddi is the national sport of Bangladesh., In Kabaddi, two teams compete with each other for higher scores, by touching or capturing the players of the opponent team. Each team consists of 12 players, of which seven are on court at a time, and five in reserve. The two teams fight for higher scores, alternating defence and offense. The court is as large as that for a dodge ball game. The game consists of two 20 minute halves, with a break of five minutes for change of sides., The kabaddi playing area is 12.50m x 10m, divided by a line into two halves. The side winning the toss sends a ‘raider’, who enters the opponents’ court chanting, ‘kabaddi-kabaddi’. The raider’s aim is to touch any or all players on the opposing side, and return to his court in one breath. The person, whom the raider touches, will then be out. The aim of the opposing team, will be to hold the raider, and stop him from returning to his own court, until he takes another breath. If the raider cannot return to his court in the same breath while chanting ‘kabaddi’, he will be declared out. Each team alternates in sending a player into the opponents’ court. If a player goes out of the boundary line during the course of the play, or if any part of his body touches the ground outside the boundary, he will be out, except during a struggle., The team scores a lona ( a bonus of two points), if the entire opposition is declared out. The game then continues by putting all the players on both sides. Matches are staged on the basis of age-groups, and weight. Seven officials supervise a match – one referee, two umpires, two linesmen, a time keeper and a scorer.
