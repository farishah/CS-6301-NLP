        "In the context of the Women's Clothing E-Commerce dataset, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can also be used to predict whether a customer would recommend a product based on the review text. Here's how CNNs work with respect to the dataset, in CNN the preprocessed text is fed into the CNN as a sequence of integers. An Embedding layer in the model maps these integers to dense vectors of fixed size, representing the words as continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space. The CNN applies one-dimensional convolution operations on the embedded word vectors. Filters of varying sizes are used to capture local patterns or n-grams (combinations of n adjacent words) in the text. These filters help to identify meaningful features or patterns that can be useful for predicting the recommendation status.\n",

Sequences shorter than 100 tokens will be padded with zeros at the end ('post' padding), and sequences longer than 100 tokens will be truncated from the end ('post' truncating). This step is crucial because neural network models require input data to have a consistent shape.\n",

        "1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a specialized type of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs in traditional RNNs when training on long sequences, making them more effective for handling sequential data.\n",
        "2. LSTMs have built-in memory cells that help retain long-term dependencies, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including text classification, without needing to rely on basic RNNs.\n",
        "3. LSTMs demonstrate better performance in handling long-range dependencies and complex sequences compared to traditional RNNs, as they can capture and preserve information over longer periods.\n",
        "4. RNNs are more prone to overfitting and struggle with capturing information from earlier time steps, whereas LSTMs are more robust and capable of learning from longer sequences, making them a better choice for most use cases.\n",
        "5. In practice, LSTMs have consistently outperformed vanilla RNNs across a variety of tasks, rendering RNNs less relevant for most applications, and justifying the preference for LSTMs for text classification problems like the Women's Clothing E-Commerce dataset."
